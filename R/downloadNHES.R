#' @title Instructions for Downloading and Unzipping NHES Files
#'
#' @description Provides instructions to download the public-use National Household Education Survey (NHES) data in SPSS (*.sav) format
#'              for use with the \code{readNHES} function.
#'              The data originates from the \href{https://nces.ed.gov/OnlineCodebook}{NCES Online Codebook} zip files.
#'              This function works for data from the years
#'              1991, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2012, 2016, and 2019.
#'
#' @param years an integer vector of the assessment years. Valid years are
#'              1991, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2012, 2016, and 2019.
#'              The instructions are the same for each year, this is used as reference only.
#'
#' @note The NHES data files are additionally available from the \href{https://nces.ed.gov/nhes/dataproducts.asp}{NHES data product page}.  However,
#'       the data files provided at that page do not include all available years of data, and contain inconsistent data file formats.
