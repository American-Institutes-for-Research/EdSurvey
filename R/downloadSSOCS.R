#' @title Instructions for Downloading and Unzipping SSOCS Files
#'
#' @description Provides instructions to download School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS) data in SAS (*.sas7bdat) format
#'              for use with the \code{readSSOCS} function.
#'              The data originates from the SSOCS Data Products website at \href{https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/ssocs/data_products.asp}{nces.ed.gov}.
#'              This function works for the following school year datasets: 2000 (1999--2000), 2004 (2003--2004), 2006 (2005--2006),
#'              2008 (2007--2008), 2010 (2009--2010), 2016 (2015--2016), and 2018 (2017--2018).
#'
#' @param years an integer vector of the study years to download. Valid years are as follows:
#' 2000, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2016, 2018 (see description).  The instructions are the same for each year, this is for reference only.
#'
#' @note The year parameter value is shortened to the ending year of the school year (e.g., 2006 refers to the 2005--2006 school year data).
#' Manually downloading the data files is required to fulfill the data usage agreement.
