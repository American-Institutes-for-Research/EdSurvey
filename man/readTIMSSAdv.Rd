\usage{
readTIMSSAdv(
  path,
  countries,
  subject = c("math", "physics"),
  forceReread = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{a character vector to the full directory path to the TIMSS Advanced extracted SPSS (.sav) set of data}

\item{countries}{a character vector of the country/countries to include using
the three-digit ISO country code.
A list of country codes can be found on Wikipedia at
\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1#Current_codes}
or other online sources. Consult the \emph{TIMSS Advanced User Guide} to help determine what countries
are included within a specific testing year of TIMSS Advanced.
To select all countries, use a wildcard value of \strong{\code{*}}.}

\item{subject}{a character value to indicate if you wish to import the \code{math} or \code{physics} dataset.
Only one subject can be read in at a time.}

\item{forceReread}{a logical value to force rereading of all processed data.
The default value of \code{FALSE} will speed up the \code{readTIMSSAdv} function by using existing read-in data already processed.}

\item{verbose}{a logical value to either print or suppress status message output.
The default value is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
an \code{edsurvey.data.frame} for a single specified country or an \code{edsurvey.data.frame.list} if multiple countries specified
}
\description{
Opens a connection to a TIMSS Advanced data file and
             returns an \code{edsurvey.data.frame} with
             information about the file and data.
}
\details{
Reads in the unzipped files downloaded from the TIMSS Advanced
international database(s) using the
\href{https://www.iea.nl/data-tools/repository}{IEA Study Data Repository}.
Data files require the SPSS data file (.sav) format using the default
filenames.

A TIMSS Advanced \code{edsurvey.data.frame} includes three distinct data levels:
\itemize{
  \item student
  \item school
  \item teacher
}

When the \code{getData} function is called using a TIMSS Advanced \code{edsurvey.data.frame},
the requested data variables are inspected, and it handles any necessary data merges automatically.
The \code{school} data always will be returned merged to the \code{student}
data, even if only \code{school} variables are requested.
If \code{teacher} variables are requested by the \code{getData} call it will cause the \code{teacher} data to be merged.
Many \code{students} can be linked to many \code{teachers}, which varies widely between countries.

Please note that calling the \code{dim} function for a TIMSS Advanced \code{edsurvey.data.frame} will result in the row count as if the \code{teacher} dataset was merged.
This row count will be considered the \code{full data N} of the \code{edsurvey.data.frame}, even if no \code{teacher} data were included in an analysis.
The column count returned by \code{dim} will be the count of unique column variables across all three data levels.
