\usage{
readHSB_Sophomore(
  HSO8092_PRI_FilePath,
  HSO8092_SASSyntax_Path,
  forceReread = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{HSO8092_PRI_FilePath}{a character value to the main study-derived 
analytical data file (HSO8092_REV.PRI). 
Located within the \code{REVISED_ASCII} folder.}

\item{HSO8092_SASSyntax_Path}{a character value to the SAS syntax file for
parsing the \code{HSO8092_REV.PRI} data file.
Located within the \code{SAS_EXTRACT_LOGIC} folder.}

\item{forceReread}{a logical value to force rereading of all processed data.
The default value of \code{FALSE} will speed up the read
function by using existing read-in data already processed.}

\item{verbose}{a logical value that will determine if you want verbose
output while the \code{readHSB_Sophomore} function is running
to indicate processing progress.
The default value is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
an \code{edsurvey.data.frame} for the HS&B Sophomore 1980--1992 longitudinal dataset
}
\description{
Opens a connection to a High School & Beyond 1980--1992 Sophomore cohort data file and
             returns an \code{edsurvey.data.frame} with 
             information about the file and data.
}
\details{
Reads in the specified \code{HSO8092_SASSyntax_Path} file to parse
the \code{HSO8092_PRI_FilePath} file.
A cached data file and metadata file will be saved in the same
directory and filename as the \code{HSO8092_PRI_FilePath} file,
having new file extensions of .txt and .meta, respectively.

Please note the original source \code{repcode} variable has been split
into two variables named \code{repcode_str} for the stratum value
and \code{repcode_psu} for the primary sampling unit (PSU) value in the resulting cache data.
