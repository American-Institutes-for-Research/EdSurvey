\usage{
DoFCorrection(
  varEstA,
  varEstB = varEstA,
  varA,
  varB = varA,
  method = c("WS", "JR")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{varEstA}{the \code{varEstInput} object returned from certain functions, such as
\code{\link{lm.sdf}} when \code{returnVarEstInputs=}\code{TRUE}).
The variable \code{varA} must be on this dataset.
See Examples.}

\item{varEstB}{similar to the \code{varEstA} argument.
If left blank, both are assumed to come 
from \code{varEstA}. When set, the degrees of freedom
are for a contrast between \code{varA} and \code{varB},
and the \code{varB} values are taken from \code{varEstB}.}

\item{varA}{a character that names the statistic in the \code{varEstA}
argument for which the degrees of freedom calculation is required.}

\item{varB}{a character that names the statistic in the \code{varEstB}
argument for which a covariance is required. When \code{varB} 
is specified, returns the degrees of freedom for
the contrast between \code{varA} and \code{varB}.}

\item{method}{a character that is either \code{WS} for the Welch-Satterthwaite
formula or 
\code{JR} for the Johnson-Rust correction to the
Welch-Satterthwaite formula}
}
\value{
numeric; the estimated degrees of freedom
}
\description{
Calculates the degrees of freedom for a statistic
             (or of a contrast between two statistics) based on the
             jackknife and imputation variance estimates.
}
\details{
This calculation happens under the notion that statistics
have little variance within strata, and
some strata will contribute fewer than a full degree of freedom.

The functions are not vectorized, so both \code{varA} and 
\code{varB} must contain exactly one variable name.

The method used to compute the degrees of freedom is in the vignette titled
\href{https://www.air.org/sites/default/files/EdSurvey-Statistics.pdf}{\emph{Statistical Methods Used in EdSurvey}}
section \dQuote{Estimation of Degrees of Freedom.}
