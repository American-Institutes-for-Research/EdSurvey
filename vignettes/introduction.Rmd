# Overview of the EdSurvey Package
  
The `EdSurvey` package is designed to help users analyze data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), including the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) datasets. Because of their scope and complexity, these datasets require special statistical methods to analyze. The `EdSurvey` package gives users functions to perform analyses that account for both complex sample survey designs and the use of plausible values.

The `EdSurvey` package also seamlessly takes advantage of the `LaF` package to read in data only when it is required for an analysis. Users with computers that have insufficient memory to read in the entire NAEP datasets can still do analyses without having to write special code to read in just the appropriate variables. This is all addressed directly in the `EdSurvey` package---behind the scenes and without additional work by the user.

* [*Using the `getData` Function in EdSurvey*](https://www.air.org/sites/default/files/EdSurvey-getData.pdf) describes  the use of the `EdSurvey` package when extensive data manipulation is required before analysis.

* [*Using EdSurvey for Trend Analysis*](https://www.air.org/sites/default/files/EdSurvey-Trend.pdf) describes the methods used in the `EdSurvey` package to conduct analyses of statistics that change over time in large-scale educational studies.

* [*Exploratory Data Analysis on NCES Data*](https://www.air.org/sites/default/files/EdSurvey-EDA.pdf) provides examples of conducting exploratory data analysis on NAEP data.

* [*Calculating Adjusted* p*-Values From EdSurvey Results*](https://www.air.org/sites/default/files/EdSurvey-pvalues.pdf) describes the basics of adjusting *p*-values to account for multiple comparisons.

* [*Producing \LaTeX \ Tables From edsurveyTable Results With edsurveyTable2pdf*](https://www.air.org/sites/default/files/EdSurvey-LaTeXtables.pdf) details the creation of pdf summary tables from summary results using the `edsurveyTable2pdf` function.


## Methodology Resources

Documents that describe the statistical methodology used in the `EdSurvey` package include the following:

* [*Statistical Methods Used*](https://www.air.org/sites/default/files/EdSurvey-Statistics.pdf) details the estimation of the statistics in the `lm.sdf`, `achievementLevel`, and `edsurveyTable` functions.

* [*Analyses Using Achievement Levels Based on Plausible Values*](https://www.air.org/resource/analyses-using-achievement-levels-based-plausible-values) describes the methodological approaches for analyses using NAEP achievement levels.

* [*Gap Analysis*](https://www.air.org/sites/default/files/EdSurvey-Gap.pdf) covers the methods comparing the gap analysis results of the `EdSurvey` package to the NAEP Data Explorer.

* [*Estimating Percentiles*](https://www.air.org/sites/default/files/EdSurvey-Percentiles.pdf) describes the methods used to estimate percentiles.

* [*Estimating Mixed-Effects Models*](https://www.air.org/sites/default/files/EdSurvey-Mixed_Models.pdf) describes the methods used to estimate mixed-effects models with plausible values and survey weights, and how to fit different types of mixed-effects models using the EdSurvey package.

* [*Multivariate Regression*](https://www.air.org/sites/default/files/EdSurvey-Multivariate_Regression.pdf) details the estimation of multivariate regression models using `mvrlm.sdf`.

* [*Running Wald Tests*](https://www.air.org/sites/default/files/EdSurvey-WaldTest.pdf) describes the use of the Wald test to jointly test regression coefficients estimated using `lm.sdf` and `glm.sdf`.

* [*Weighted and Unweighted Correlation Methods for Large-Scale Educational Assessment: wCorr Formulas*](https://www.air.org/resource/weighted-and-unweighted-correlation-methods-large-scale-educational-assessment-wcorr) introduces the methodology used by the wCorr R package for computing the Pearson, Spearman, polyserial, polyserial, polychoric and tetrachoric correlations, with and without weights applied.

## Software Requirements

Unless you already have R version 3.2.0 or later,  install the latest R version---which is available online at [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/). Users also may want to install RStudio desktop, which has an interface that many find easier to follow. RStudio is available online at  [https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

# Setting Up the Environment for Analyzing NCES Data

## Installing and Loading `EdSurvey`

Inside R, run the following command to install `EdSurvey` as well as its package dependencies:

```{r code options, echo = FALSE}
options(width = 85)
```

```{r source package, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("EdSurvey")
```
Once the package is successfully installed, `EdSurvey` can be loaded with the following command:

```{r load package, results="hide", message=FALSE}
library(EdSurvey)
```
