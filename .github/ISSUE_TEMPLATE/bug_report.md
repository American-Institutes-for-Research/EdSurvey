1. Brief description of the problem and what output you expect


2. Provide a [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example) (AKA a reprex). The goal of a reprex is to make it as easy as possible for our team to recreate your problem so that we can fix it. If you've never heard of a reprex before, start by reading <https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex>.
```r
# insert a reprex here
```

3. Type `sessionInfo()` in the Rstudio console, and copy and paste the output. This information will help us understand the R environment you are in when encountering the issue.
```r
# insert the `sessionInfo()` output
sessionInfo()
```
